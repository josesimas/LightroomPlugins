# Lightroom Classic Plugins

Squares: Find all the images with the cropped aspect ratio of 1:1 and create a collection named Squares with all these images. This plugin was developed using ChatGPT and it is an interesting exercise on how ChatGPT can be useful. I had never developed anything in Lua neither had I ever developed or looked into the code of a LrC Plugin. This took the best part of two hours to develop and test.

To use this plugin in Lightroom Classic clone this repository and rename the folder squares to squares.lrplugin. Add the plugin in Lightroom under File->Plugin Manager. I only tried this on a Mac but I suppose it works fine in Windows as well.
